\title{Compute the determinant}
\usage{
rray_det(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A square matrix to compute the determinant for.
Alternatively, a higher dimensional array which is treated as a stack
of matrices computed from the first two dimensions.}
}
\description{
\code{rray_det()} computes the determinant of a matrix.
}
\examples{
x <- matrix(1:4, ncol = 2)

# Dimensions are kept
rray_det(x)

x_3d <- rray_broadcast(x, c(2, 2, 3))

# 3D matrices are treated as stacks of 2D matrices
rray_det(x_3d)
